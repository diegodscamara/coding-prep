# Comprehensive Interview Guide

## Introduction: Why You're Probably Doing LeetCode Wrong
In the world of technical interviews, many candidates fall into the trap of memorizing problems and rushing to code. This approach is akin to trying to pass a math exam by memorizing every question rather than understanding the underlying formulas and patterns. The key to success lies in grasping the concepts and applying them to solve new problems.

## Understanding the Interview Process
Companies often refrain from using LeetCode questions directly in interviews. The primary goal of an interview is to assess how you tackle unfamiliar problems, not how well you've memorized answers. Even if you've solved hundreds of problems, you might still struggle if you haven't honed your problem-solving and adaptability skills. Interviewers are interested in your ability to think on your feet and apply your knowledge to novel situations.

## Emphasizing Patterns Over Problems
A crucial aspect of interview preparation is learning to recognize problem-solving patterns, such as sliding window, recursion, and binary search. This approach is similar to mastering cooking techniques instead of memorizing individual recipes. By understanding these patterns, you can apply them across a wide range of problems, enhancing your versatility and efficiency.

## Demonstrating Your Thought Process
Providing the correct answer in an interview is not enough. Interviewers want to see how you approach, think, and communicate your solutions. Solving a problem without "showing your work" is like giving a math result without the steps. Clearly articulating your thought process not only helps the interviewer understand your approach but also allows you to identify and correct any mistakes along the way.

## The Importance of Asking Questions
In an interview, you won't always receive all the information upfront. Asking clarifying questions is a critical part of the process, much like debugging a program. You can't fix a bug without understanding the full context. By asking questions, you demonstrate your ability to gather necessary information and adapt your approach accordingly.

## Collaborating with Your Interviewer
It's essential to view your interviewer as an ally rather than an adversary. They are there to help you succeed, so don't hesitate to ask for feedback and clarification. Think of them as a guide in an escape room, providing clues to help you navigate challenges. Engaging with your interviewer in this way can lead to a more productive and insightful interview experience.

## Strategic Questioning to Filter Solutions
Good questions can help you eliminate ineffective approaches and highlight better ones. For instance, asking if the data is sorted can rule out unnecessary sorting algorithms. By strategically questioning the problem, you can streamline your approach and focus on the most promising solutions.

## Exploring Multiple Solutions
When faced with a problem, it's beneficial to brainstorm multiple solution paths and seek feedback on which one the interviewer prefers. This approach is similar to pitching two design ideas to a client and getting their input before proceeding. By exploring different avenues, you demonstrate your creativity and willingness to adapt based on feedback.

## Key Takeaway
Ultimately, the goal of interview preparation is not to memorize answers but to learn how to think critically and adaptively. Practice solving problems, communicating your thought process, asking insightful questions, and adapting to new information. These skills are what interviews truly test, and mastering them will set you apart as a candidate.
