Here's an 80/20 summary of the video transcript from the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLlXCFG5TnA) on solving the Two Sum problem:

### Brute Force Approach
- **Concept**: The brute force method involves checking every combination of two values in the input array to see if they sum to the target.
- **Process**: For each element, iterate through the rest of the array to find a pair that sums to the target.
- **Complexity**: This approach has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) due to the nested loops, making it inefficient for large arrays.

### Optimized One-Pass Approach
- **Concept**: The optimized solution uses a hash map to store each number's index as you iterate through the array.
- **Process**:
  1. For each number, calculate the complement (target - current number).
  2. Check if the complement exists in the hash map.
  3. If it exists and is not the same index, return the indices.
  4. If not, add the current number and its index to the hash map.
- **Efficiency**: This method allows for a single pass through the array, achieving a time complexity of \(O(n)\) and a space complexity of \(O(n)\) due to the hash map storage.

### Key Insights
- **Hash Map Usage**: The hash map allows for constant time lookups, making it efficient to check for the complement.
- **One-Pass Advantage**: By building the hash map on-the-fly, you avoid the need for a separate initialization step, reducing code complexity and potential errors.
- **Guaranteed Solution**: The problem guarantees a solution exists, simplifying the logic as you don't need to handle cases where no solution is found.

### Coding the Solution
- **Implementation**: The video demonstrates coding the solution using a hash map to store previous elements and their indices, iterating through the array once to find the solution.
- **Result**: The solution is efficient and works perfectly, reducing the amount of code and handling edge cases seamlessly.
