# Week 3: Merge Two Sorted Lists (Linked List)

This week focuses on merging two sorted linked lists, a fundamental linked list operation often solved using iterative pointer manipulation or recursion.

## Learning Workflow

1.  **JS Grammar:** Review `class`, `this`, `.next` property usage, and recursion patterns in JavaScript, especially for linked list structures.
    *   [JS Grammar Notes](./js-grammar.md)
2.  **Concept Class:** Understand the iterative (dummy head, pointers) and recursive approaches to merge two sorted lists.
    *   [Concept Notes](./concept.md)
3.  **Video Lesson:** Watch NeetCode's explanation.
    *   [NeetCode - Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIdigk956u0)
4.  **Article:** Read the GeeksforGeeks article for another perspective.
    *   [GeeksforGeeks - Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-two-sorted-linked-lists/)
5.  **Challenge:** Implement the solution on LeetCode.
    *   [LeetCode â€“ Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)
    *   [Practice Implementation](./practice.js)
6.  **Anki Cards:** Create flashcards for the `ListNode` class structure, iterative/recursive merge patterns, pointer manipulation, base cases, and time/space complexity trade-offs.
